PHASE ERROR STATISTICS
========================================================================================================================

Total paired measurements: 50
Mean phase error:          -173.2 ms
Std deviation:             936.2 ms
Min error (most early):    -1035.0 ms
Max error (most late):     +2465.0 ms

Status Breakdown:
  GOOD (±10ms):         0 (0.0%)
  WARNING (±50ms):      0 (0.0%)
  OVERLAP (<-50ms):    30 (60.0%)
  DRIFT (>50ms):       20 (40.0%)

========================================================================================================================
BLE LINK QUALITY CORRELATION ANALYSIS
========================================================================================================================

GOOD timing (±10ms): No measurements

WARNING timing (±50ms): No measurements

POOR timing (>50ms) (50 measurements):
  RSSI: No data
  RTT:  mean=89.5 ms, min=72.655, max=92.608
  Quality: mean=100.0%, min=100%, max=100%

========================================================================================================================
OUTLIER ANALYSIS - POOR timing cycles (>50ms error)
========================================================================================================================

Total POOR cycles: 50
  Weak RSSI (<-90 dBm): 0 cycles
  High RTT (>100ms): 0 cycles
  Low Quality (<50%): 0 cycles

Recommendations:
  [OK] 50/50 POOR cycles have GOOD BLE metrics
       -> Timing errors NOT caused by BLE link quality
       -> Likely algorithmic issue (convergence, correction limits, prediction)

========================================================================================================================
KEY:
  'CLIENT @'   = CLIENT activation time relative to SERVER (ms)
  'Target @'   = Ideal antiphase target (period/2 after SERVER)
  'Phase Err'  = CLIENT timing error from target (negative=early, positive=late)
  'RSSI'       = BLE signal strength (dBm, -50=excellent, -90=poor)
  'RTT'        = Round-trip time for sync beacons (ms)
  'Quality'    = Time sync quality (0-100%)
  'OVERLAP'    = CLIENT too early (>50ms before target, risk of both motors active)
  'DRIFT'      = CLIENT too late (>50ms after target, poor bilateral alternation)
  'WARNING'    = Within ±50ms of target (acceptable but not ideal)
  'GOOD'       = Within ±10ms of target (excellent bilateral coordination)
