# UPSTREAM_NOTES.md — RBS-LM research subtree

Per `[[feedback_upstream_srmech_fixes_as_research_notes]]`: srmech issues
land here as research notes, NEVER as edits to the srmech package directly.

Each entry lists a gap or candidate addition surfaced by RBS-LM partition
work. Entries are advisory for future srmech catalog work; the research
subtree continues to use bare numpy where catalog coverage is absent.

## §1 Gaps surfaced by R-RBS-LM-49z (2026-05-26)

### 1.1 `srmech.signal_processing.path_b_ops.rfft` missing

**Current state:** `path_b_ops.fft.op` returns full complex DFT; no
real-FFT variant.

**Use case:** 49 Method B and similar bit-string FFT cascades take real
input (bipolar bits in {-1, +1}). Using full FFT is 2× the compute and
2× the memory of `rfft`. Algebra-identical; not a correctness issue.

**Candidate addition:** `path_b_ops.rfft.op(signal, n=None, axis=-1, ...)`
mirroring `numpy.fft.rfft`. Path A reference: `numpy.fft.rfft`. Path B
identity: cyclic-DFT with conjugate-symmetry exploitation; Class A ∘
Class I ∘ Class K composition on the real-symmetric half-substrate.

**Status:** Documented gap, NOT a blocker. 49z used full FFT and
confirmed bit-identical parity to bare numpy.

---

### 1.2 Signed-sum coupling-score primitive missing

**Current state:** `srmech.amsc` has Class K (sign-flip / pin-slot) and
Class C (chirality / cascade-orientation) but no composite "compute
signed-sum coupling score across multiple bit-string sources" primitive.

**Use case:** R-RBS-LM-33 weak-coupling-truncate and 49 Method C both
need `coupling_sq = (sum_sources(2 * bits - 1))^2`. This is structurally
Class K (bipolar transform) + Class L (signed-magnitude-squared) but
operates on a stack of source-arrays not a single graph.

**Candidate addition:** `srmech.amsc.coupling.signed_sum_squared(sources)`
or `compose.signed_coupling_score(sources)` that takes a list of bit
arrays and returns the squared signed-sum element-wise. Per
`[[feedback_sign_handling_is_class_k_pin_slot_not_alu_abs]]`: no abs()
calls inside; the algebra is signed-arithmetic + square.

**Status:** Documented gap. 49z left Method C as bare numpy with a
docstring annotation that the operation IS Class K + Class C composition.

---

### 1.3 No catalog primitive for argsort-by-score

**Current state:** `srmech.amsc.search` has multi-needle pattern match
(Class D) and `amsc.catalog` has sorted-key lookup (Class E), but no
"sort N items by N-vector of scores and return top-K indices."

**Use case:** Method B band selection (top-K bands by squared magnitude),
Method C low-coupling selection (bottom-K bits by coupling-squared).

**Status:** Documented gap; arguably NOT a Class-N concern. argsort is
a generic-array operation, not a substrate-coupling or content-addressing
operation. Lives more naturally in numpy. Catalog addition would be
ergonomic (one-stop import) but not architectural.

---

### 1.4 No catalog primitive for random bit-flip

**Current state:** `srmech.amsc` has no random sampling. Class K is the
sign-flip operation at the chosen positions; random selection of those
positions is substrate-randomness.

**Use case:** Method A in 49 stage A (crude random precision reduction
baseline).

**Status:** Documented gap; NOT a Class-N concern. Per the 14-class
A-N partition discipline, random sampling is substrate-property, not
form-property. srmech catalog appropriately omits it. The Method A
random selection stays bare numpy (or python random).

---

## §2 Gaps surfaced by R-RBS-LM-54 arc (54f–54r, 2026-05-26)

### 2.1 Class L Laplacian + HDC bundle interaction

**Current state:** `srmech.amsc.laplacian.dense_laplacian` returns a
real-symmetric Laplacian; `hermitian_eigendecompose` returns eigvals +
eigvecs. The eigvecs come back as complex arrays even though the
Laplacian is real-symmetric, due to general Hermitian solver dispatch.

**Use case:** 54 partitions repeatedly cast `eigvec.real` to discard
the imaginary noise. Caused a `ComplexWarning` in 54h, 54j, 54q before
explicit `.real` casts were added.

**Candidate addition:** `dense_laplacian_real(n, edges, weights)` +
`symmetric_eigendecompose(L)` variants that guarantee real outputs.
Alternatively, document that eigvecs from real-symmetric Laplacian may
return complex-typed with negligible imag parts; users should call
`.real`.

**Status:** Documented; workaround in place (`.real` cast). Not a
blocker.

---

### 2.2 No catalog primitive for find-cascade alignment

**Current state:** 54c and follow-ups implement greedy-bipartite
alignment between two eigvec tables by HDC content-similarity. Pattern:
score matrix → argmax row-by-row with used-set tracking.

**Use case:** Cross-substrate kernel alignment is a load-bearing
operation in the Rosetta Stone Layer architecture. It's not currently
a catalog primitive.

**Candidate addition:** `srmech.amsc.compose.greedy_bipartite_alignment(
table_A, table_B, similarity_fn)`. Returns a dict mapping A-positions
to (B-position, similarity).

**Status:** Documented. The implementation is ~15 lines of straightforward
greedy matching; arguably a "research utility" not a primitive. Could
be a srmech.utils helper if a utils module exists.

---

## §3 Notes on what NOT to add

Per `[[project_a_n_operators_are_harmonic_objects_themselves]]` 14-class
discipline:

- **Random sampling** is substrate-property, NOT a class. Don't add it.
- **Generic argsort** is a numpy concern, not a srmech class concern.
- **Bit packing/unpacking** is a serialization detail; Class B (TLV)
  handles the framing layer; bit-level unpacking inside frames is fine
  to keep as numpy.
- **Cosine similarity** is already in `srmech.amsc.hdc.similarity`; new
  catalog work doesn't need to duplicate it.

## §4 Class M rank-2 abelian variant: Klein-4 binding (Finding 132 / R-RBS-LM-97, 2026-05-27)

**Background.** Per `[[user_stance_canonical_two_variant_dial_class_m]]`
(MFO §VIII.31.7): Class M's existing variants are rank-1 abelian XOR
over F₂^D (current `srmech.amsc.hdc`) and rank-N non-abelian Lie bracket
over Hermitian N×N matrices (planned; BFSS / SU(N) gauge). The integer-
ladder runs {0, 1, 2, …, N, …}.

The rank-2 abelian variant — Klein-4 XOR over (F₂)² = Z₂ × Z₂ — sits
between these two existing variants on the same ladder. F132 + R-RBS-
LM-97 prototype confirms all algebraic properties bit-exact:

- Self-inverse: a ⊕ a = identity ✓
- Commutative: a ⊕ b = b ⊕ a ✓
- Associative: ✓
- 4 distinct elements per position (state ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3})
- Identity (0, 0)
- Native chirality-flip = XOR with sector mask (O(D) cost)

**Motivation.** Per `[[user_stance_dark_visible_two_cl7_irreps]]` +
Spike #69 SIGN-FORCED-BY-Cl(7)-IDEMPOTENT: the 4 Klein-4 elements map
directly to the 4 chirality sectors (γ₅, iω₇) of the 4-way (γ₅, i·ω₇)
decomposition (MFO §VII.4.1.7). The rank-2 abelian binding gives
native substrate-chirality storage that the rank-1 bipolar variant
cannot provide.

**Candidate additions to `srmech.amsc.hdc`** (proposed; not yet
implemented per upstream-as-research-notes discipline):

```python
# New Class M rank-2 abelian variant
klein4_random(D, rng) -> uint8 array of D elements ∈ {0,1,2,3}
klein4_bind(a, b)     -> component-wise XOR over (F₂)²
klein4_unbind(c, a)   -> self-inverse: c ⊕ a
klein4_bundle(*vecs)  -> per-bit majority vote
klein4_similarity(a, b) -> match-fraction
klein4_chirality_flip_gamma5(v)  -> XOR with sector mask 2
klein4_chirality_flip_omega7(v)  -> XOR with sector mask 1
klein4_cpt_mirror(v)             -> XOR with sector mask 3
klein4_sector_count(v) -> [count per sector] for debugging/attestation
```

**Working prototype**: `docs/srmech/rbs_lm_research/R-RBS-LM-97_klein4_hdc_full_chirality_smoke.py`
— pure Python; all algebraic properties confirmed; ~150 LOC; results in
`R-RBS-LM-97_klein4_results.json`.

### §4.1 Upstream procedure (if/when authorized)

Per CLAUDE.md "Tag flow for a new rc" + `[[feedback_always_rc_first_for_downstream_publishes]]`,
the path is:

1. **Branch**: `git checkout -b feat-klein4-class-m-rank-2-abelian`
2. **Bump version**: srmech v0.4.2 → v0.4.3rc1 in 4 SSOT files
   (current production v0.4.2; latest TestPyPI rc was v0.4.2rc5):
   - `python/pyproject.toml`
   - `python/pyproject-pure.toml`
   - `python/srmech/version.py`
   - `c/include/srmech.h` (SRMECH_VERSION_PRE + SRMECH_VERSION)
3. **Python implementation** in `python/srmech/amsc/hdc.py`:
   - Add new functions alongside existing bipolar XOR
   - Mark variant in docstring per `[[user_stance_canonical_two_variant_dial_class_m]]`
   - Add to `tool_schema.py` ToolEntry registrations
4. **C implementation** in `c/src/srmech_hdc.c`:
   - `srmech_klein4_bind(uint8_t* a, uint8_t* b, size_t D)` (or similar API)
   - JPL Power-of-Ten compliance (function ≤ 60 lines, ≥ 2 asserts)
   - Add to `c/include/srmech.h` public API surface
   - DO NOT bump ABI version (adding new symbol, not changing wire format)
5. **Tests** in `python/tests/test_hdc_klein4_parity.py`:
   - Parity test C vs Python (bit-exact required)
   - Algebraic property tests (self-inverse, commutativity, associativity)
   - Chirality-flip correctness tests (sector swap verification)
   - CPT substrate-symmetry test
6. **JPL audit ratchet** must stay at zero violations:
   - Update `tests/test_jpl_audit.py` exempt list ONLY if functions
     need it (document rationale in JPL_AUDIT.md)
   - All new C functions ≤ 60 lines per Rule 4
   - At least 2 asserts per new C function per Rule 5
   - No goto, no malloc, no multi-line macros
7. **Pedantic-build CI** must pass on all 3 cells (Linux gcc / macOS clang /
   Windows MSVC) with -Werror / /WX
8. **CHANGELOG.md** entry under `[0.4.1rc1]` heading describing the
   Class M rank-2 abelian variant addition
9. **PR → review → MERGE** (NOT squash per `[[feedback_no_squash_merges]]`)
10. **Tag** `srmech-v0.4.3rc1` on the merge commit
11. **Publish workflow** auto-publishes to TestPyPI
12. **Verify in clean venv outside repo tree**:
    ```bash
    cd /tmp/verify_srmech_klein4_rc1
    python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
    pip install --no-cache-dir \
        --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
        --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ \
        --pre "srmech==0.4.3rc1"
    python -c "from srmech.amsc.hdc import klein4_bind, klein4_chirality_flip_gamma5; ..."
    # Confirm HAS_NATIVE=True (native dispatch picks up C surface)
    ```
13. **Multiple rc cycles** if needed (rc1, rc2, ...) until verification clean
14. **Production tag** `srmech-v0.4.3` only after clean TestPyPI rc

**Estimated scope**: ~200 LOC Python + ~150 LOC C + ~150 LOC tests +
JPL audit pass = one rc round if no surprises; may need 2-3 rcs if
JPL Power-of-Ten edge cases surface.

**Version target context** (verified 2026-05-27):
- Current production: srmech v0.4.2 (PyPI)
- Latest TestPyPI rc: srmech v0.4.2rc5
- Klein-4 addition would target v0.4.3rc1 → v0.4.3
- ABI: stays at current value (adding new symbol, not changing wire format)

### §4.2 Status

**NOT YET AUTHORIZED to begin upstream work.** User direction
2026-05-27: "if we do want to make C/Python parity code changes to
srmech, do so with rc versions on testpypi" — procedural reminder,
not immediate go-ahead.

Prototype lives in R-RBS-LM-97 research subtree. Upstream work
begins only on explicit user direction.
