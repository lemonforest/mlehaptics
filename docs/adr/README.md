## How to Create a New ADR

1. **Copy the template:**
   ```bash
   cp docs/adr/_template.md docs/adr/NNNN-your-decision-title.md
   ```

2. **Fill in all sections:**
   - Date, Phase, Status, Type
   - Summary (Y-Statement)
   - Problem Statement, Context, Decision
   - Consequences (Benefits & Drawbacks)
   - Options Considered (with pros/cons)
   - Related Decisions
   - Implementation Notes

3. **Update this index:**
   - Add row to Quick Navigation table
   - Add to appropriate Phase section
   - Add to Status section
   - Add to Type section

4. **Reference in code:**
   ```c
   // Per AD040, we check firmware version compatibility
   // See docs/adr/0040-firmware-version-checking.md
   ```

5. **Commit with clear message:**
   ```bash
   git add docs/adr/NNNN-*.md docs/adr/README.md
   git commit -m "[ADR] Add ADNNN: Title"
   ```

## ADR Migration Notes

**Original Location:** `docs/architecture_decisions.md` (4,354 lines, 186 KB)
**Reason for Migration:** Exceeded Claude Code read tool token limit (25,000 tokens)
**Migration Date:** 2025-11-21
**Commit Hash:** _[to be added]_

**Benefits of File-Per-AD Structure:**
- ✅ Individual ADs readable by AI tools (500-1000 tokens each)
- ✅ Fast grep/search for specific decisions
- ✅ Automated cross-reference validation
- ✅ Clear template for future decisions
- ✅ Parallel development (no merge conflicts)
- ✅ Granular git history per decision

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Original file archived at `docs/archive/architecture_decisions.md`
- "AD0XX" reference format works with both old and new structure
- Links in code/docs can gradually migrate to new location
