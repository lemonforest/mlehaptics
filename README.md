## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a two-device bilateral stimulation system for EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy. Two identical ESP32-C6 devices automatically discover and pair with each other, then provide synchronized alternating stimulation patterns with safety-critical non-overlapping timing. The system uses professional ERM (Eccentric Rotating Mass) motors for tactile stimulation with H-bridge bidirectional control, and includes LED testing capabilities during development.

**Current Development Status:**
- ✅ Phase 4 JPL-compliant firmware complete (single-device testing)
- ✅ BLE GATT server for mobile app configuration (5 operational modes)
- ✅ Hardware v0.663399ADS with GPIO crosstalk fixes implemented
- 🔄 Dual-device bilateral coordination protocol in development

**Key Features:**
- **Configurable bilateral frequency**: 0.25-2 Hz (500-4000ms total cycle time)
- **Precise half-cycle allocation**: Each device gets exactly 50% of total cycle
- **JPL-compliant timing**: All delays use FreeRTOS vTaskDelay() (no busy-wait loops)
- **Adaptive watchdog feeding**: Short cycles feed at end, long cycles feed mid-cycle + end (4-8x safety margin)
- **Haptic effects support**: Short vibration pulses within half-cycle windows
- **Open-source hardware**: Complete PCB designs, schematics, 3D-printable cases

## 🔌 Hardware Overview

## 🛡️ Safety-Critical Development Standards

### ESP-IDF Framework Requirements
- **Mandatory Version**: ESP-IDF v5.5.0 (latest stable, enhanced ESP32-C6 support)
- **Platform**: PlatformIO espressif32 v6.12.0 with official Seeed XIAO ESP32-C6 support
- **Framework**: ESP-IDF (not Arduino) for real-time guarantees
- **Rationale**: Enhanced ULP support, BR/EDR + Wi-Fi coexistence, MQTT 5.0, proven stability

### JPL Institutional Coding Standard Compliance
This project follows **JPL Coding Standard for C Programming Language** for safety-critical medical device software:

**Memory Management:**
- ✅ No dynamic memory allocation (malloc/free) during runtime
- ✅ Static allocation only for all data structures
- ✅ Stack usage analysis with defined limits

**Control Flow:**
- ✅ No recursion - all algorithms use iterative approaches
- ✅ **No busy-wait loops** - all timing uses vTaskDelay() or hardware timers
- ✅ Limited function complexity (cyclomatic complexity ≤ 10)
- ✅ Single entry/exit points for all functions
- ✅ No goto statements except error cleanup

**Safety Requirements:**
- ✅ Comprehensive error checking for all function calls
- ✅ Bilateral timing precision ±10ms maximum deviation from configured cycle time
- ✅ Emergency shutdown within 50ms of button press
- ✅ Non-overlapping stimulation patterns (devices never stimulate simultaneously)
- ✅ 1ms dead time at end of each half-cycle (included within timing budget)

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **ESP-IDF v5.5.0**: Automatically managed by PlatformIO via `platformio.ini`
- **PlatformIO**: Install via VS Code extension or standalone
- **Two Seeed Xiao ESP32-C6 boards**: Hardware platform requirement (dual-device mode)
- **Hardware files**: See [hardware/README.md](hardware/README.md) for PCB manufacturing and case printing

### Build and Deploy

1. **Clone repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lemonforest/mlehaptics.git
   cd mlehaptics
   ```

2. **Open in PlatformIO**: File → Open Folder → select project directory

3. **Verify ESP-IDF version configuration**: 
   - The `platformio.ini` file at the project root uses ESP-IDF v5.5.0
   - PlatformIO will automatically download and use the correct version
   - Build output will confirm "ESP-IDF v5.5.0" is being used
   
   **Working configuration in `platformio.ini`:**
   ```ini
   platform = espressif32 @ 6.12.0  ; Official Seeed XIAO ESP32-C6 support
   framework = espidf               ; Platform auto-selects ESP-IDF v5.5.0
   board = seeed_xiao_esp32c6       ; Official board definition
   ```

4. **Build project**: PlatformIO → Build (Ctrl+Alt+B)
   - First build will download ESP-IDF v5.5.0 (~1GB, takes ~10 minutes)
   - Verify build output shows "framework-espidf @ 3.50500.0 (5.5.0)"
   - Subsequent builds: ~1 minute incremental

5. **Upload to device(s)**: PlatformIO → Upload (Ctrl+Alt+U)

### First Power-On

**Single-Device Mode (Current Testing):**
1. **Power device** - use nRF Connect app to configure parameters
2. **5 operational modes**: Four presets + custom BLE-controlled mode
3. **Hold button 5 seconds** to shutdown

**Dual-Device Mode (In Development):**
1. **Power both devices** - they will automatically pair within 30 seconds
2. **Status LED patterns**:
   - Fast blink = searching for server  
   - Slow blink = waiting for client
   - Solid on = connected and bilateral active
3. **Test bilateral stimulation** - Motors alternate based on configured cycle time:
   - Default 1000ms cycle: Each motor active for 499ms (with 1ms dead time)
   - Fast 500ms cycle: Each motor active for 249ms (2 Hz bilateral rate)
   - Slow 2000ms cycle: Each motor active for 999ms (0.5 Hz bilateral rate)
   - **NO overlap** at any cycle time setting
4. **Hold button 5 seconds** on either device to shutdown both

## 🔧 Bilateral Timing Architecture

### Configurable Cycle Times

**Total cycle time** is the primary configuration parameter:
- **Range**: 500-4000ms (displayed to therapists as 0.25-2 Hz)
- **Default**: 1000ms (1 Hz, traditional EMDR bilateral rate)
- **Half-cycle allocation**: Each device gets exactly total_cycle / 2

### Timing Budget Examples

**1000ms Total Cycle (1 Hz):**
```
Server: [===499ms motor===][1ms dead][---499ms off---][1ms dead]
Client: [---499ms off---][1ms dead][===499ms motor===][1ms dead]
```

**500ms Total Cycle (2 Hz):**
```
Server: [===249ms motor===][1ms dead][---249ms off---][1ms dead]
Client: [---249ms off---][1ms dead][===249ms motor===][1ms dead]
```

**2000ms Total Cycle (0.5 Hz):**
```
Server: [===999ms motor===][1ms dead][---999ms off---][1ms dead]
Client: [---999ms off---][1ms dead][===999ms motor===][1ms dead]
```

### Dead Time Implementation

**1ms FreeRTOS delay at end of each half-cycle:**
- **JPL compliant**: Uses vTaskDelay(), no busy-wait loops
- **Watchdog feeding**: esp_task_wdt_reset() called during 1ms delay
- **Hardware protection**: GPIO write latency (~50ns) provides natural MOSFET dead time
- **Minimal overhead**: 1ms = 0.1-0.4% of half-cycle time
- **Included in budget**: Motor active time = (half_cycle_ms - 1)

| 🚨 **Error** | SOS pattern | Critical error |

## 🔬 Development Configuration

### ⚠️ Critical Build System Constraint

**ESP-IDF uses CMake - PlatformIO's `build_src_filter` DOES NOT WORK!**

ESP-IDF framework delegates all compilation to CMake, which reads `src/CMakeLists.txt` directly. PlatformIO's `build_src_filter` option has **NO EFFECT** with ESP-IDF.

**Required approach**: Python pre-build scripts modify `src/CMakeLists.txt` for source file selection.

**📚 See for complete details:**
- **`docs/ESP_IDF_BUILD_CONSTRAINTS.md`** - Full explanation, examples, and common mistakes
- **`docs/architecture_decisions.md`** - AD022: Build System Architecture

### Build Standards and Quality Assurance

#### Code Quality Requirements
- **C language only**: No C++ features (JPL standard compliance)
- **No busy-wait loops**: All timing uses vTaskDelay() or hardware timers
- **Static analysis**: Code must pass JPL-compliant static analysis tools
- **Function complexity**: Maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10
- **Stack analysis**: All functions must have bounded stack usage
- **Error handling**: All functions return esp_err_t for operations that can fail

#### Build Flags (config.h)
```c
// Development mode configuration
#define ENABLE_FACTORY_RESET    1   // 0 = disable for production
#define TESTING_MODE           1   // 0 = production build
#define DEBUG_LEVEL            3   // 0 = no logging, 4 = full debug

// JPL Coding Standard compliance
#define JPL_COMPLIANT_BUILD    1   // Enable JPL standard checks
#define ESP_IDF_TARGET_VERSION "v5.5.0"  // Verified ESP-IDF version

// Bilateral timing configuration
#define BILATERAL_CYCLE_TOTAL_MIN_MS    500     // 2 Hz max
#define BILATERAL_CYCLE_TOTAL_MAX_MS    2000    // 0.5 Hz min
#define BILATERAL_CYCLE_TOTAL_DEFAULT   1000    // 1 Hz default
#define MOTOR_DEAD_TIME_MS              1       // FreeRTOS delay
```

#### Validation Requirements

3. Test at multiple cycle times (500ms, 1000ms, 2000ms)
4. Confirm non-overlapping stimulation patterns with oscilloscope
5. Test coordinated shutdown from either device

#### Single-Device Testing  
1. Power single device
2. Use nRF Connect app for BLE configuration
3. Test all 5 operational modes
